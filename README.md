## ML Model Explanation with Random Forest 
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to build and explain a Random Forest Classifier using RAI Widgets.It provides an insight on demonstrating the use of the Microsoft Responsible AI Toolbox in different datasets. The notebook includes the following steps:  
1. **Install Packages**: Install necessary libraries such as `raiwidgets`, `rai-core-flask`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` to ensure all required tools are available.
2. **Import Libraries**: Import essential libraries for data manipulation, model training, and explanation, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, and `raiwidgets`.
3. **Generate Synthetic Hiring Dataset**: Create a synthetic dataset simulating a hiring process with features such as years of experience, education level, skill score, certifications, and leadership score. This dataset is used to train and evaluate the model.
4. **Load Student Performance Dataset**: Load a student performance dataset from a CSV file, preprocess it by encoding categorical variables, and split it into training and testing sets. This dataset helps demonstrate the model's application in an educational context.
5. **Load Iris Dataset**: Load the Iris dataset, preprocess it, and split it into training and testing sets. This classic dataset is used to showcase the model's performance on a well-known classification problem.
6. **Preprocess Data**: Encode categorical variables and split the data into training and testing sets for each dataset. This step ensures the data is in the correct format for model training.
7. **Train Model**: Train a Random Forest Classifier on the training data for each dataset. The Random Forest algorithm is chosen for its robustness and ability to handle various types of data.
8. **Explain Model**: Use the `TabularExplainer` from the `interpret-community` package to generate a global explanation of the model's predictions for each dataset. This step provides insights into how the model makes decisions and which features are most important.
9. **Dashboard**: Launch the `ExplanationDashboard` to visualize and interpret the model's behavior and feature importance for each dataset. The dashboard offers an interactive way to explore the model's explanations and understand its decision-making process.


This project provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and interpreting machine learning models using different datasets, ensuring transparency and accountability in the decision-making process. By following the steps outlined in the notebook, users can gain insights into the inner workings of their models and make informed decisions based on the explanations provided.
